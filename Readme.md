 ## SOFTWARE TESTING
 
 Software testing is an activity perform on the application in order to verify and validate that the application meet all the predefine requirements.
 
Software can be tested either manually or using automation tools, we then have:
 
 #### - Manual Testing
 
 Manual testing is a process of testing the software manually to find defects. 
 
 #### - Automation Testing
 
 Automation testing is the process of testing the software using an automation tool to find the defect. In this process, testers execute the test scripts and generate the results automatically by using automation tools.
 
 Some of the automation testing tools for functional testing are QTP and Selenium.
 
 Within testing we have: SDLC(Software Development Life Cycle) and STLC(Sofware Testing Life Cycle).
 STLC is a testing process and a phase which an application under test goes through.
 We have different model of SDLC which are:
 
 - Waterfall Model
 
 - V-Model 
 
 - Agile Model
 
 For the Waterfall model and the V- model, testing activities comes at the end of the entire implementation of the software, but V- Model has a particularity 0f verification and validation for each corresponding phases of SDLC.
 Agile model is an iteration process where testing activity start at the very beginning of the software project and testers are involved in every stage of the Software Development Life Cycle.
 
 Software Testing Life Cycle has different phases that must be followed for a software free of Bugs. Those phases are:
 
 - ##### Requirement Analysis
 
 In this phase Business Analyst provide a Document called Business Requirement Document(BRD), Business Requirement Specification(BRS), Functional Requirement Specification(FRS), Functional Requirement Document(FRD), the name varies from a company to another.Testing team study and analyse the requirement, and the activity consist on understanding the requirements, identifying whether the requirements are testable or not, communicate back and forth with stackholders so the mitigation strategy can be planned.
 
 - ##### Test Planning
 
 Test planning is the first step of the testing process. In this phase tester determine the effort and the cost estimated for the entire project. Base on the requirement analysis, we determine the role and the responsabilities, tool selections(if automation), training requirement, the type of testing to perform for the specific project, schedule in which testing will be done, the starting time and the finish time.
 
 - ##### Test Design
 
 Test cases are prepared in this phase, test scripts, and test data. Test cases prepared are reviewed by peer members or team lead. Requirement Traceability Matrix(RTM) is prepared. RTM traces the requirements to the test cases that are needed to verify whether the requirements are fulfilled. It wil show us where we come and where we are we are going, this helps to ensure that all requirements will be covered in the testing phase to satisfy 100% coverage rule.
 
 - ##### Test Environment set up
 
 This phase can start in parallel with test design phase. Test environment is provided, meanwhile test team should prepare the SMOKE Test cases to check the readiness of the given test environment.
 
 - ##### Test Execution
 
 In this phase we start executing the test cases based on planned test cases, update the test cases in case of Pass/Fail, we prepare the defedt report for Fail test cases and reported to development team via test management tool or defect tracking tool. 
 
 - ##### Test Closure
 
 
  The testing is performed based on two methods:
  
  ###### Static Testing and Dynamic Testing.
  
  About the Static Testing, also known  as verification in software testing. It is a process to ensure that whether we are building the product right. For example, to verify the requirements which we have and to verify whether we are developing the product accordingly or not.
  Activities involved here are inspections, reviews and walkthrough. 
  
  Dynamic Testing is also known as validation in software testing.
  Validation is a dynamic process of testing the real product. It is the process in which we validate whether we are building the right product, to validate the product which we have developed is right or not.
  Activities involved in this is :Testing the software application.
  The validation of the product here is performed using different types of software testing which can be:
  ##### Unit Testing
  ##### Smoke and Sanity Testing
  ##### Retesting
  ##### Regression testing
  ##### Integration Testing
  ##### System Testing
  ##### UAT(User Acceptance Testing) 
  
  Each phases of STLC has an entry and an exit criteria.
  
  ####### Entry criteria 
  
Is define as the prerequisite that must be achieve before commencing the testing process.
  
  ####### Exit criteria
  
Is the condition that must be met before testing should be concluded.
  
  For the
  ######## Requirement Analysis phase
  Exit criteria : Requirement Document
  
  ######## Testing Planning phase 
  Entry criteria : Requirement Document
  Exit criteria : Test Strategy, Test Plan, Test effort estimation.
  
  ######## Test Design phase
  Entry criteria : entry and exit criteria of testing planning phase
  Exit Criteria : Test cases, RTM, Test scripts, Test data, Test coverage, test environment.
  
  ######## Test Execution 
 Entry criteria : entry and exit criteria of Test design phase
 Exit criteria : Test case execution report, defect report, RTM report.
 
 ######## Test Closure phase
 Entry criteria : Test case execution report(Make sure there are not high severity defect opened), Defect report.
 Exit criteria : Test  closure report, test metrics.
